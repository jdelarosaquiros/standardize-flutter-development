# Standardize Flutter Development
This project is to practice and set standard practices for developing apps in Flutter.

## Creating Color Scheme
In Flutter 3.0, there are three ways of creating a color scheme. 

One is to use a color seed and generating the entire theme based on that color:
* Using a single color: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ColorScheme/ColorScheme.fromSeed.html
* Using multiple colors: https://flutterawesome.com/a-more-flexible-version-of-flutters-colorscheme-fromseed/

Another way is to generate the theme based on an image, and the other one is to generate them based on a set of custom/brand colors:
* Using image in material design: https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/dynamic
* Using custom colors in material design: https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/dynamic
* Using material design in Figma: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/Material-Theme-Builder
